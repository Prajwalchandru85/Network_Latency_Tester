# Web-Based Network Latency Tester  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, WebSockets (`ws` package)  

## Brief Introduction  
This project is a **real-time web-based network latency tester** that measures the round-trip time (RTT) between a client and server. It uses **WebSockets** for communication and visualizes latency trends dynamically using **Chart.js**.  

## Features  
✅ **Real-time Latency Measurement** – Calculates round-trip latency between client and server.  
✅ **Graph Visualization** – Displays latency variations using a dynamic graph.  
✅ **WebSocket Communication** – Uses a full-duplex WebSocket connection for efficiency.  
✅ **Minimal and Clean UI** – Simple and interactive design.
